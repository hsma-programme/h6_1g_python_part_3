This repository contains the materials for HSMA 6 Session 1G - Python Programming part 3

The notebooks in the h6_1g_python_part_3 can be downloaded and run locally if you have Python installed.

Alternatively, you can run each exercise on **Google Colab**, a free online platform for coding exercises. You will need to be logged in to a google account in your browser. 

Using the links below will open a fresh copy of the notebook to work on - your changes will not be visible to anyone else. However, if you want to be able to refer back to your version of the notebook in future, make sure you click **'File --> Save to Drive'**. 
Your changes will then be saved to your own account, and you can access your edited copy of the notebook from https://colab.research.google.com/.

**Note: when you first run a cell, you will need to click 'run anyway' in the popup that appears. This is a standard pop-up that appears for any notebook you haven't created from scratch yourself!**
